# Error design

How should you handle errors in your program? This chapter aims to answer that question. The first section will help you categorise and characterise errors. The second section will help you design error handling 'in the large' (issues like whether to recover from an error, when to use different kinds of errors, etc.), the third section is specifically about designing error types in your program.
