# Error design

How should you handle errors in your program? This chapter aims to answer that question. The first section will help you categorize and characterize errors. The second section will help you design error handling at a high level (issues like whether to recover from an error, when to use different kinds of errors, etc.), and the third section is specifically about designing error types in your program.
