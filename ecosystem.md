## Historic crates

As Rust's error handling story has evolved, many error handling libraries have come and gone. The following were influential in their time, but there are now better alternatives (sometimes including just the support in std). You might still see these crates used in historic documentation, but we wouldn't recommend using them any more.

* error-chain (support is now in std)
* failure (support is now in std)
* fehler (an experiment which is no longer maintained)
* err-derive (support is built in to the recommended crates)
